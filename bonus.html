            <p>
                As part of 'Inside Matters; Brentford head coach discusses why talking can be positive for improving mental health

                She talks a lot. Rookie mistake!" laughed

                <a href="https://www.premierleague.com/managers/44742/Thomas-Frank/overview" target="_blank">Thomas Frank</a>,
                after making a surprise phone call to check on his mother-in-law as part of the Premier League's
                <a href="https://www.premierleague.com/insidematters" target="_blank">"Inside Matters"</a>
                campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
                Frank has joined his fellow Premier League managers, and players from all top-flight clubs,
                in getting involved with "Inside Matters", which raises awareness of mental health and encourages
                fans to check in on the wellbeing of others.
            </p>
            <p>
                To help initiate conversations around mental health, Frank was invited to make a call to check in
                on a friend or a loved one.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see in the video above, he chose his mother-in-law, who Frank said he cared about a lot but
                rarely spoke to on the phone.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a conversation covering topics ranging from coffee and garden moles, to Brentford's next
                match and the family's support of him, Frank reiterated the importance of checking in with loved ones.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
                <p>She's getting older so a call from me, or her daughter or son or other daughter, gives her a lot.</p>
                <p>"I think every single time you do it [make a call] you get a positive response. You make other people happy, it makes you happy."</p>
