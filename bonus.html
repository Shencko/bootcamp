        <p> <strong>Frank:</strong> Making a call can make other people happy </p>
        <p><strong>As part of 'Inside Matters; Brentford head coach discusses why talking can be positive for improving
                mental health</strong></p>
        <p>She talks a lot. Rookie mistake!" laughed <a
                href="https://www.premierleague.com/clubs/130/Brentford/overview">Brentford</a> head coach <a
                href="https://www.premierleague.com/managers/44742/Thomas-Frank/overview">Thomas Frank,</a>
            after making a surprise phone call to check
            on his mother-in-law as part of the Premier League's <a
                href="https://www.premierleague.com/insidematters">"Inside Matters"</a> campaign.

            Frank has joined his fellow Premier League managers, and players from all top-flight clubs, in getting
            involved with
            "Inside Matters", which raises awareness of mental health and encourages fans to check in on the wellbeing
            of others.

            To help initiate conversations around mental health, Frank was invited to make a call to check in on a
            friend or a loved
            one.

            As you can see in the video above, he chose his mother-in-law, who Frank said he cared about a lot but
            rarely spoke to
            on the phone.

            After a conversation covering topics ranging from coffee and garden moles, to Brentford's next match and the
            family's
            support of him, Frank reiterated the importance of checking in with loved ones.

            "[She's] getting older so a call from me, or her daughter or son or other daughter, gives [her] a lot," he
            said.

            "I think every single time you do it [make a call] you get a positive response. You make other people happy
            - it makes
            you happy."</p>
