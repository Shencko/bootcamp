# ⚽ Copy of the English Premier League Webpage

## 📝 Project Summary

This is a simple football league webpage initially built with only HTML. Our team upgraded the project by adding structured and modern CSS to enhance the visual appeal and maintainability of the site. The redesigned version is more accessible, responsive, and visually consistent.

Our improvements included:

- Implementing **CSS variables** to maintain consistent color and spacing themes across the site.
- Following the **BEM (Block Element Modifier)** naming convention to ensure cleaner, modular, and maintainable code.
- Using **relative CSS units** (like `em`, `rem`, `%`) to make the layout more responsive and adaptable to various devices.
- Adding a **CSS animation** to the form's page  to make it more dynamic and engaging.
